### Adversarial Search on (m, n, k)-games

For this coursework you have to implement adversarial search by Minimax and α-β pruning to
play (m, n, k)-games.
An (m, n, k)-game is a board game in which two players, Max and Min, take turns in placing Xs
(Max) and Os (Min) on an m × n board, the winner being the player who first gets k Xs (resp. Os)
in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Thus, tic-tac-toe is the (3, 3, 3)-game.
